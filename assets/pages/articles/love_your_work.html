            Why is it important for us to love the work we do? <br><br>

            Often times, as a student, I find myself putting off my studies, assignments, or tasks that need to be done. It is too easy for me to get started on the first episode of that show and too hard to get started on the first problem of my problem set. It is too easy for me to give into gaming with friends and too hard to firmly refuse in order to reply to the dozens of emails in my inbox. Why is that the case? Well, most people would say it’s because I like watching Netflix more than problem sets and because I like gaming more than sending emails. But the funny thing is that, more often than not, I end up working on my problem sets and I end up sending those emails. There are two possible reasons for this: <br><br>

            1. I am more obligated to finish work than I am obligated to have fun.<br>
            2. Though I like fun more than I like work, I love work more than I love fun. <br><br>

            Thinking about these things sent me in a spiral of other questions, some getting dangerously philosophical and so I’ll list them here and move on: <br><br>

            1. What does it mean to love something or someone?<br>
            2. How is loving a person different than loving an action (such as work)?<br>
            3. Can you love work for itself or only for the benefits it produces for you?<br>
            4. Is it ever truly feasible or possible for us as humans to love something purely for itself?<br>
            5. Why does an article seeking to answer a question only produce more questions?<br><br>

            There is one point that I want to get across from this piece of writing: we should try to love our work because doing so will make our lives easier. Economically, the more we love our work, the less costly (in effort or time) it will feel to us and the more rewarding it will feel to us. Easier said than done, though, right? How can we just love our work with a snap of the finger? Well, many have deemed that love is actually a choice – one we make consciously and of our own will. Some also say that love is a skill (see footnote), though maybe it is a combination of feeling, choice, and skill.
