						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the Modular Scale for font sizes which is super helpful
								for finding ratios of font sizes. I often just wing it and pick whatever sizes
								look fine, but this adds some structure that I can follow in the future.
								Now I may try utilizing the Golden Ratio or even the Perfect Fourth.
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I appreciated how they provided references for other websites or
								articles that might be helpful. As a reader, I like to know where sources or
								inspiration comes from for these kinds of articles.
								Furthermore, they have little embeds with a sneakpeak of what the websites 
								have to offer!
