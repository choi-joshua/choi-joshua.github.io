						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> While I was already aware of the importance of accessibility in colors for design,
								I didn't realize that there were scales/grades that actually tangibly distinguish good from bad.
								I find that interesting to consider because, while color combinations may look asethetically pleasing,
								there are certain factors that go into the. Thus, it is important to be aware of our unawareness
								as it relates to people with disabilities.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I personally enjoyed tehe reference they linked to color combinations and testing the acessabiility of each.
								 It's fun to see how people will go far to make and share resources to help others: in this case, a website that
								helps us pick color combinations.
							I am hopeful that more resources and websites like this will be shared. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude. </p>
						</li>
