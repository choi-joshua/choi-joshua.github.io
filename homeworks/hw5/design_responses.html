                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned about how important text is with UX/UI. Animations and transitions are cool, but in products or websites they are pointless
                                if they aren't conveying some kind of information. Almost all of these designs had some kind of usage of text. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed the simplicity. I liked the layout of the article itself that avoids distracting from the designs. I liked how they gave credit. </p>

                            <p> The welcome screen had a really unique transition effect... almost liquid-like? The 
                                one on groceries was nice because I like food and plants and produce.
                            The dark promotion was quite spooky and achieved a cool effect.
                        These all created ambience. </p>
